Ship It Saturday 8-hour hackathon

Broadway By Request is a show where the audience picks the songs to be sung from a pool of about 50 musical numbers. On an average night, only about 15-20 songs will be performed. Due to the professional nature of the show, the director had to keep track of who was singing what song on a given night (since they rotated singers often). Originally she was tracking this information via a Word document. I decided this would make a great hackathon project.

Status: Functional.
Next steps: Testing and User Auth.
